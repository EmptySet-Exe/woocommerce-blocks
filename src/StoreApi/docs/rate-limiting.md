[Rate Limiting](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/5962) can now be enabled for Store API endpoints.
This was designed to prevent abuse of endpoints from excessive calls and performance degradation on the machine running the store.

It is unauthenticated, rate limits are keyed by either `USER ID` (logged in) or `IP ADDRESS` (guest user), and standard support for running behind a proxy, load balancer, etc. for unauthenticated users can be enabled.

## Limit information

A maximum of 5 requests can be made within a 60-second time frame.

## Methods restricted by Rate Limiting

`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`

## Enabling Rate Limiting

A filter is available for enabling/disabling rate limiting:

```php
add_filter( 'woocommerce_store_api_enable_rate_limit_check', '__return_true' );
```

## Proxy standard support

If the Store is running behind a proxy, load balancer, cache service, CDNs, etc. keying limits by IP is supported through standard IP forwarding headers, namely:

- `X_REAL_IP`|`CLIENT_IP` *Custom popular implementations that simplify obtaining the origin IP for the request*
- `X_FORWARDED_FOR` *De-facto standard header for identifying the originating IP, [Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For)*
- `X_FORWARDED` *[Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Forwarded), [RFC 7239](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7239)*

This is disabled by default.

### Enabling Proxy support

```php
add_filter( 'woocommerce_store_api_rate_limit_enable_proxy_support', '__return_true' );
```

## Limit usage information observability

Current limit information can be observed via custom response headers:

- `RateLimit-Limit` *Maximum requests per time frame.*
- `RateLimit-Remaining` *Requests available during current time frame.*
- `RateLimit-Reset` *Unix timestamp of next time frame reset.*
- `RateLimit-Retry-After` *Seconds until requests are unblocked again. Only shown when the limit is reached.*

### Response headers example

```http
RateLimit-Limit: 5
RateLimit-Remaining: 0
RateLimit-Reset: 1654880642
RateLimit-Retry-After: 28
```

## Tracking limit abuses

This uses a modified wc_rate_limit table with an additional remaining column for tracking the request count in any given request window.
A custom action `woocommerce_store_api_rate_limit_exceeded` was implemented for extendability in tracking such abuses.

### Custom tracking usage example

```php
add_action(
    'woocommerce_store_api_rate_limit_exceeded',
    function ( $offending_ip ) { /* Custom tracking implementation */ }
);
```
